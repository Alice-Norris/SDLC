Portfolio and coursework for the Software Development Lifecycles course at SNHU

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by trying to determine. what the user is actually asking for. Many users can express something they desire or have disliked about previous software solutions, but there is usually more to the story. Strong communication skills are necessary to find and address these additional details, and notes should be taken, and concerns or desires rephrased and repeated to make sure that my understanding of the user's needs matches what they are actually asking for. Creating user stories helps with this process by capturing the essence of what the user is asking instead of simply writing technical requirements.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing programs, I like to first spend some time planning what the individual pieces need to be to achieve the desired goal, and what supporting data structures will be necessary to make those pieces work together. After completing the underlying framework, I will usually move on to designing a user interface around the components and data structures that make the program work. In the future, I plan to use boards to track individual tasks, even when working alone, and will probably begin using Sprints to give a short term goal and a definite checkpoint for my progress. This course has already changed how I develop my personal projects, and have most recently started using Azure DevOps to organize my development (instead of multiple, poorly organized text documents)

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development involves being communicative, humble, accountable, and proactive. If a team member is accountable and humble, they can share what mistakes have been made, what works and what hasn't, and can be honest with themselves and others about what is needed or what is done. A lot of this lines up with being communicative. If no one knows some task is complete or that an obstacle has impeded progress, the rest of the team can't help or utilize the work that has been done. Proactivity is also important. If a team member is proactive, they can often solve a problem before it becomes critical, or even avoid the problem entirely. By combining these attributes, I can ensure that I am helping the team move toward its goal, thus being a credit instead of a liability.
